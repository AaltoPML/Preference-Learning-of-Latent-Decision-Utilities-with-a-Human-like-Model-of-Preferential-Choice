# District-Smart

This directory contains two data processing files:
- extract_district_features.R
- extract_district_rankinsgs.R

Both scripts download the original District-Smart data from github, and process it into a format suitable for our implementation. We include these in the interest of reproducibility. However you do not need to run these scripts; we have made the data they produce available with our implementation.
